"Amidst the rush to build AI agents, let's reflect: What defines an agent? It's more than just replacing a process. True agents decide, act, learn, and adapt iteratively. Let's not dilute the term 'agent' with basic automation scripts. Where do we draw the line? #AI #Tech"




Critique:
Your tweet thread is informative and thought-provoking, offering insights into what truly constitutes an AI agent. You effectively highlight the distinction between basic automation tools and genuine agents that exhibit autonomous decision-making and iterative learning. The examples you provide help clarify your points and make the concept more accessible to your audience.

Recommendations:
1. **Engage with your audience:** Encourage interaction by posing a question or soliciting opinions at the end of your thread to prompt responses and foster a discussion. This can help boost engagement and virality.
2. **Conciseness:** While the content is engaging, consider condensing your points slightly to make it easier for readers to grasp your key messages quickly. Shorter tweets have a higher chance of being shared widely due to their easy consumption.
